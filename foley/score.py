"""``score()`` — the one-call AI-first entry: narration text → a tasteful, woven sound design.

The stable high-level contract downstream packages (``braidio``, ``nw``) and AI agents call:
hand it narration text (a string, or a list of segments) and — optionally — the narration
audio, and it runs the full SELECT→WEAVE arc with tasteful restraint, returning an **editable
timeline**, a per-segment **rationale**, and (when audio is given) a **mastered mix** + SDH
captions + credits. It composes the existing façade (``find`` → ``plan`` → ``weave``) under one
observability run scope; every knob is an optional keyword with a smart default.

The "taste" is inherited from the SELECT policy, not re-invented here: the salience/density
budget keeps it sparse (not every sentence gets a sound), the **fail-closed license gate**
runs before verification, and the verify ladder (clap → listen → judge) guards fit — so a
one-call ``foley.score(segments, audio=...)`` yields a restrained, license-clean result.

Stdlib-only at import (numpy/torch/whisperx stay lazy inside ``find``/``weave``), so importing
this keeps ``import foley`` dol-only.

    editable :class:`~foley.base.SoundDesignTimeline`, and — when ``audio`` is given (or
    ``weave=True``) — aligns + weaves into a mastered mix. Returns a :class:`ScoreResult`.

    Args:
        segments: The narration text — a single string, or a list of segment strings.
        audio: The narration voice audio (path / bytes / ndarray / a library ref). When
            given, the result is woven into a mastered mix (set ``weave=False`` to skip).
        transcript: The full narration transcript for alignment (default: the segments joined).
        library: The :class:`foley.index.SoundLibrary` (default: the process-wide default).
        intended_use: The rights intent (default:
            :data:`foley.licensing.DEFAULT_INTENDED_USE` — commercial publishing, the
            same default as :func:`foley.find` and every MCP tool).
        commercial_ok: Shorthand override of the default intent's ``commercial``;
            ``False`` explicitly admits non-commercial material.
        max_events: The sparse density cap **per segment** (restraint).
        verify: The max verify rung — ``'clap'`` | ``'listen'`` | ``'judge'``.
        master: The delivery :data:`~foley.base.MASTER_PROFILES` target (``'podcast'`` default).
        weave: Force weaving on/off; default auto (``True`` iff ``audio`` is given).
        llm: Which LLM the SELECT rungs use (``'fake'`` | ``'local'`` | ``'anthropic'``;
            ``None`` reads ``$FOLEY_LLM``, else the free default) — see :func:`foley.find`.
        budget: The run's :class:`~foley.agent.policy.Budget` — one spend cap
            (``max_usd``, default $1) across every segment's paid calls (#57).
        **weave_kwargs: Forwarded to :func:`foley.weave` (e.g. ``sign_cert``, ``watermark``).

    Returns:
        A :class:`ScoreResult` (``timeline`` + ``events`` rationale; ``weave`` when woven).
