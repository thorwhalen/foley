"""Symbolic-anchor → sample-onset heuristics — the SELECT→WEAVE timing bridge (report 06 §2.4).

Pure, stdlib-only functions that turn a placed sound's *symbolic* anchor (SELECT's
``"on 'pushed open'"`` string, or a resolved :class:`~foley.base.Placement`) into a
concrete trigger time (seconds) against a forced-aligned ``word_timeline``
(``[{'word','start','end'}, ...]``). Cheapest-first, exactly as report 06 §2.4:

* **word anchor** (one-shots) — fire on the onset of the trigger word;
* **pre-roll** — shift a clip earlier so its salient transient lands on the anchor;
* **sentence span** (beds) — start at the first word of the sentence, run to the last;
* **scene / paragraph boundary** (stingers, ambience swaps) — the boundary's first word;
* **pause snapping** — nudge an onset to the nearest inter-word gap to avoid masking speech.

These are pure ``(anchor, word_timeline) -> seconds`` functions with no I/O and no
heavy dependency, so they are independently unit-testable and keep ``import
foley.weave`` dol-only. ``foley.weave.anchor.parse_symbolic_anchor`` is the single
SSOT bridge from SELECT's sparse ``TimelineItem.onset`` string to a
:class:`~foley.base.Placement`.
