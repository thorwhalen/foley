"""System-dependency onboarding for WEAVE's optional upgrade paths (accompy-style).

``ffmpeg`` (the two-pass ``loudnorm`` "guarantee the numbers" master, report 06 §5.4)
and ``rubberband`` (time-stretch / pitch for loop fitting) are **system** binaries,
never pip dependencies — the default WEAVE path is pure-numpy + ``pyloudnorm`` and
degrades gracefully when they are absent. This module is the SSOT for what those
binaries are, how to detect them (``shutil.which``), and how to install them per
platform; it mirrors accompy's ``check_requirements`` progressive-disclosure
onboarding. Stdlib-only, so importing it keeps ``import foley.weave`` dol-only.
