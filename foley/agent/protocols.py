"""The structural DI seams of the SELECT stage — ``Decomposer`` / ``Judge`` / ``Refiner``.

Three ``@runtime_checkable`` :class:`typing.Protocol`\\ s (PEP 544), each a
behaviour-free, open-closed contract that every implementation (the deterministic
fake *and* the Anthropic-backed real impl) satisfies. They are dependency-injected
into :func:`foley.agent.find` by keyword (``decomposer=`` / ``judge=`` / ``refiner=``),
defaulting to a hermetic fake when ``anthropic`` (the ``foley[agent]`` extra) is absent.

Stdlib-only: the ``base`` shapes are imported under ``TYPE_CHECKING`` only (mirroring
:mod:`foley.index.protocols`), so importing this module pulls no heavy dependency and
keeps ``import foley`` dol-only.
