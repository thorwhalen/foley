"""Tier-1 retrieval evaluation — metrics, a frozen golden set, and the nDCG gate.

This subpackage answers "did we retrieve the right sound?" with TREC-style
ranking metrics (``nDCG@10`` / ``Recall@k`` / ``mAP@10`` / ``MRR@10``) over a
frozen golden set, and ships the **PR gate**: a pytest check that blocks a change
whose ``nDCG@10`` regresses by more than ``0.02`` on the Ring-0 golden set. Every
part is pure numpy/stdlib and deterministic — no ``ranx``/``numba``, no CLAP, no
downloads — so the gate runs on every index/embedder/prompt PR in foley's CI.

Tier-2 fit-judging (#10b) — "does this clip match the intent?" — lives alongside
in :mod:`~foley.eval.fit` (the judge-based fit harness), :mod:`~foley.eval.reliability`
(Krippendorff's α + judge-vs-human calibration), and :mod:`~foley.eval.fidelity`
(set-level FAD/KAD generation fidelity). Tier-2 is nightly/pre-release + cost-gated —
NOT a per-PR gate — and never touches the retrieval ranking. All numpy imports are
function-local so ``import foley`` stays dol-only.
