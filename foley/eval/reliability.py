"""Inter-rater reliability — Krippendorff's α + the judge-vs-human calibration guardrail.

Whatever judges foley's fit — humans or an LLM/audio-LM — you must **quantify agreement
before trusting the scores** (report 08 §2.3). This module is the numbers side of that
guardrail: one pure-numpy Krippendorff's α (the most general reliability coefficient —
any number of raters, ordinal/graded labels, missing-data tolerant), reused for BOTH
human inter-rater reliability on the gold grades AND judge-vs-human calibration (the
model judge is just one more rater row). A model judge is only promoted to unattended
use once it reaches human-level agreement on a calibration slice.

Pure numpy / stdlib, deterministic — ``numpy`` is imported function-locally so importing
this module keeps ``import foley`` dol-only (the same discipline as
:mod:`foley.eval.retrieval`). No ``scipy``, no external reliability toolkit (a PyPI
``krippendorff`` oracle cross-check lives behind an opt-in test only).
